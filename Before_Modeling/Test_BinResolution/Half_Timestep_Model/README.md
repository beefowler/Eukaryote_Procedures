# Half Timestep Model

Do not confuse this with the original model we use in the paper. 

This is the collection of scripts as in Model_Essentials that have been modified to operate with twice the volume bins and half the timestep (now 5 minutes) in order to test for the model's sensitivity to these choices. It is best to keep these scripts seperate and only move into this directory if you would like to use the half-timestep model.
